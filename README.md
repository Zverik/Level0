# Level0 OpenStreetMap Editor

This is a text-based in-browser editor for OSM data. See [its wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Level0) and [language guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Level0L).

## Installation

You will need PHP with `mod_gettext`.

* Copy all files from `www` to a document root directory.
* Open [this link](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/username/oauth_clients/new) and register your instance of Level0. It needs permissions for reading user details and modifying the map.
* Edit `config.php`, inserting both OAuth keys.
* Create `data` directory and give writing permissions for it to web server process. Check path in `config.php`.
* Check path to document root in `locales/deploy_locales` and run it.

You're set: download some data in the editor and login to OSM.

Oh, one more thing: there will be a lot of `.base` files in the data directory. To clean them, run `crontab -e` and add this line (change path accordingly):

    0 * * * * find /var/www/level0/data -type f -mtime 1 -delete
